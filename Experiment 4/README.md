Experiment-4 : State Management (using Redux)
Local state : using useState hook
Global state: using Redux & Context API

Learning Outcomes:-
Learned to use Redux to manage global state in a React app.
Learned to Increase and decrease a counter using Redux.
Learned to understand the difference between local state and Redux state.

Redux is a state management library used with React. It helps in managing global data across components. Redux stores all application data in a single store. Actions describe what change should happen. Reducers decide how the state changes. useSelector is used to read data from the store. useDispatch is used to send actions to the store. Redux makes state changes predictable and easy to debug.
