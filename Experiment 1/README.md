_________________________________________________________________
A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application where the browser loads one HTML page only once. After that, all interactions happen without reloading the page.
_________________________________________________________________
Example:

When you open a website like Gmail or Instagram, the page loads once.

When you click on Inbox, Profile, or Messages, the page does not reload.

Instead, JavaScript sends a request to the server, gets data (usually in JSON format), and updates only the required part of the page.

How it works (simple flow):

Browser loads one HTML file.

JavaScript controls navigation and content.

Backend sends only data, not full pages.

Page content changes dynamically.

In short:
SPA gives a faster and smoother user experience because it avoids repeated page reloads.
