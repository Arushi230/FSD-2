Experiment Name:Develop RESTful APIs Using Backend Framework (Flask)

Learning Outcomes:
 Understand the fundamentals of REST architecture and HTTP methods.
 Learn how to build backend services using the Flask framework.
 Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through API endpoints.
 Gain knowledge of organizing application routes using Flask Blueprints.
 Develop skills in testing APIs using tools like Postman or Thunder Client.

In this experiment, a RESTful API was developed using the Flask backend framework. The application was designed to manage student data by implementing CRUD operations through various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The project followed a modular structure using Blueprints to ensure better organization and scalability. The APIs were tested locally to verify proper request handling and JSON responses.
